The FastAPI Listing Library is a Python library for building fast, extensible, and customizable data listing APIs.

## Usage
Configure `fastapi-listing` where to look for db `session`.
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

from fastapi_listing.middlewares import DaoSessionBinderMiddleware

def get_db() -> Session:
    """
    replicating sessionmaker for any fastapi app.
    anyone could be using a different way or opensource packages to produce sessions.
    it all comes down to a single result that is yielding a session.
    for the sake of simplicity and testing purpose I'm replicating this behaviour in this way.
    :return: Session
    """

    
app = FastAPI()

app.add_middleware(DaoSessionBinderMiddleware, master=get_db, replica=get_db)
```
How a typical data listing API would look like using `fastapi-listing`
```python
from fastapi_listing import ListingService, FastapiListing
from fastapi_listing import loader
from app.dao import EmployeeDao # More information is available in docs


@loader.register()
class EmployeeListingService(ListingService):

    default_srt_on = "Employee.emp_no" # configure default field to use for sorting data set.
    default_dao = EmployeeDao
    default_page_size = 2 # default page size. accepts dynamic vals from client

    def get_listing(self):
        fields_to_read = ["emp_no", "birth_date", "first_name",
                          "last_name", "gender", "hire_date", "image"]
        resp = FastapiListing(self.request, self.dao, fields_to_fetch=fields_to_read
                              ).get_response(self.MetaInfo(self))
        return resp
```

Just call `EmployeeListingService(request).get_listing()` from FastAPI routers.

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter
from fastapi_listing.paginator import ListingPage # Automatic Listing api doc Generation. You can use it as adapter to change meta info in page layout.

from app.service import EmployeeListingService

router = APIRouter(prefix="/emps")

@router.get('/', response_model=ListingPage[EmployeeListingDetail])
def get_emps(request: Request):
    return EmployeeListingService(request).get_listing()
```

Use pydantic to avoid writing field_to_fetch
```python
@loader.register()
class EmployeeListingService(ListingService):

    default_srt_on = "Employee.emp_no"
    default_dao = EmployeeDao
    default_page_size = 2

    def get_listing(self):
        resp = FastapiListing(self.request, self.dao, pydantic_serializer=EmployeeListingDetail
                              ).get_response(self.MetaInfo(self))
```

## Thinking about adding filters???
Don't worry I've got you coveredðŸ˜Ž
Say you want to add filter for:
1. Employees gender - return only employees belonging to 'X' gender where X could be anything.
2. Employees DOB - return Employees belonging to a specific range of DOB.
3. Employee First Name - return Employees only starting with specific first names.
```python
from fastapi_listing.filters import generic_filters # collection of inbuilt filters


@loader.register()
class EmployeeListingService(ListingService):

    filter_mapper = {
        "gdr": ("Employee.gender", generic_filters.EqualityFilter),
        "bdt": ("Employee.birth_date", generic_filters.MySqlNativeDateFormateRangeFilter),
        "fnm": ("Employee.first_name", generic_filters.StringStartsWithFilter),
    }
    
```
Check out [docs](https://fastapi-listing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html#adding-filters-to-your-listing-api) for supported list of filters.
Additionally, you can create **custom filters** as well.
## Thinking about adding Sorting???
I won't leave you hanging there as wellðŸ˜Ž
```python
@loader.register()
class EmployeeListingService(ListingService):
    sort_mapper = {
        "cd": "Employee.emp_no",
        "bdt": "Employee.birth_date"
    }

```
## Provided features are not meeting your requirements???
It is customizable.ðŸ˜Ž

You can write custom:

[Paginator](https://fastapi-listing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html#pagination-strategy)

## Features

 - Easy-to-use API for listing and formatting data
 - Built-in support for pagination, sorting and filtering
 - Well defined interface for filter, sorter, paginator
 - Support Dependency Injection for easy testing
 - Room to adapt the existing remote client query param semantics
 - Write standardise listing APIs that will be understood by generations of upcoming developers
 - Write listing features which is easy on human mind to extend or understand
 - Break down the most complex listing data APIs into digestible piece of code 

With FastAPI Listing you won't end up like
