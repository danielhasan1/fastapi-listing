        # among various clients. Still leaving room for extension won't hurt
        # by default even if client is sending multiple sorting params we prioritize
        # the latest one which is last column that client requested to sort on.
        # if user want they can implement their own asc or dsc sorting order strategy and
        # decide how they really want to apply sorting params maybe all maybe none or maybe
        # conditional sorting where if one param is applied then don't apply another specific one, etc.
